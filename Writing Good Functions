## Keys To A Good Function

What differentiates a "good" Python function from a crappy one? You'd be surprised at how many definitions of "good" one can use. For our purposes, I'll consider a Python function "good" if it can tick off most of the items on this checklist (some are not always possible):

    Is sensibly named
    Has a single responsibility
    Includes a docstring
    Returns a value
    Is not longer than 50 lines
    Is idempotent and, if possible, pure

For many of you, this list may seem overly draconian. I promise you, though, if your functions follow these rules, your code will be so beautiful it will make unicorns weep. Below, I'll devote a section to each of the items, then wrap things up with how they work in harmony to create "good" functions.
